# Changelog

Engineering release notes. Primary reader: future Claude. Detailed on purpose —
enough to understand *what* changed and *why* without digging through diffs.

## Unreleased

**The pen in the menu bar carries the update, like the frog and the parrot.** A left click on the tray icon now opens a menu — *Check for updates*, *Show Quill*, the version, *Quit* — instead of toggling the window. The one update item turns into "Update to vX.Y.Z" once a release is found, and the tray icon takes a green badge (`icons/tray-update.png`); a test fails if that icon ever ships without its `#2ecc71` pixels.

The update button is gone from the settings panel, and so is the glowing gear: the tray is visible all day, the settings panel is opened about once a month. `check_for_update` / `install_update` are no longer commands — nothing in the window asks for them. The background poll calls the same `announce_update()` as the manual check, so a release found either way gives the same signal.

**The README is a shop window, not a manual.** Same shape as Ribbit and CopyPaster now: three fat download buttons at the top, the "older versions" link pointing at `/releases` (every version — so a bad build can be rolled back) rather than `/releases/latest` (one release and its files), and the stack / build / tests / signing moved to `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`. The old page also claimed the API key lives in the OS keychain — it lives in a private 0600 file, and `secrets.rs` explains at length why that was deliberate.

## 0.1.30 — no Dock icon

**Was.** Quill showed up in the Dock and in Cmd-Tab like a regular app, unlike
Ribbit and CopyPaster. Nothing chose that: it is what macOS does by default, and
the one line that says otherwise was never added here. Beyond the clutter, a
regular app *activates itself* when its window appears — pulling focus off the
text the user is correcting, which is exactly what Quill must not do.

**Now.** `ActivationPolicy::Accessory` in `setup()` (macOS-only), same as Ribbit:
menu-bar utility, no Dock icon, no Cmd-Tab entry. The tray icon is how you reach
it, as before.

## 0.1.29 — the window stops rubber-banding

**Was.** A two-finger swipe anywhere in the window elastically dragged the whole
page: the app "skin" slid inside its own frame and bared what sat behind the
window. Since the window is borderless + `transparent: true` (that's what gives
the rounded macOS corners), the exposed strip showed the desktop — read as white
gaps along the edges. WKWebView rubber-bands the document by default; nothing in
the CSS forbade it. CopyPaster already had the guard, Quill and Ribbit never got
it.

**Now.** `html, body` are pinned — `height: 100%`, `overflow: hidden`,
`overscroll-behavior: none` — so the document can neither scroll nor bounce. The
three scroll regions (`.log`, `.view-panel`, `#debug-content`) get
`overscroll-behavior: contain`, so hitting the end of a list doesn't chain the
gesture up to the document.

**Tests.** `src/window_chrome.test.js` reads `editor.css` and fails if the root
block or any scroller loses its rule — the bug itself only reproduces on a real
macOS build, so the CSS is pinned instead of eyeballed. `npm test` 9 pass.
Settings screenshotted after the change: layout unchanged.

**Elsewhere.** Same guard applied to Ribbit; the `vibe-apps` skill now carries the
root block as a copy-paste baseline plus a "what must never happen" checklist for
new apps.

## 0.1.28 — model stack: endpoint + model per card, Groq, auto-fallback

**Was.** The settings "Model" dropdown picked a *provider*, not a model: base url
and model id were compile-time constants in `corrector::PROVIDERS`. No way to
point Quill at a different model on the same provider, at a self-hosted endpoint,
or at Groq at all. A rate-limited or dead provider failed the correction outright.

**Now.** `config.json` holds an ordered `providers` stack (`fallback.rs`, ported
from Ribbit — which runs the same machine over two stacks; Quill has one, so the
`Stack` selector is gone and the state is a single global). Each entry is
`{id, label, url, model, key_env}`; endpoint, model id and key are editable per
card behind the gear. Order is priority: the top entry runs, and on a transient
failure the walk falls through to the next entry *within the same request*, so the
correction the user is waiting on still lands. Repeated transient failures
(threshold, default 2) stick the switch until a cooldown (default 60 min) snaps
back to the first card; both knobs are in settings.

- **Failure classification** (`fallback::classify`, the one place the rule lives):
  429 / 5xx / timeout / transport → `Switch` (try the backup). 4xx and an
  unusable-but-200 body → `Hard`, surfaced immediately: a bad key/url/model is a
  config bug to see, not something to mask behind a slower backup.
- **Groq added to the catalog** — `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`,
  default `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`; `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
  is the 17B alternative (both ids verified live against Groq's `/models`). LPU
  inference lands a 70B answer in well under a second, so it's the new primary.
- **Custom endpoints** — the "+ add model" picker has a `custom…` option: blank
  url/model and its own key slot (`QUILL_KEY_<id>`).
- **Keys** stay in the private 0600 config file, now one slot per stack entry.
  `secrets::load_into_env` takes the slots from the configured stack instead of
  the catalog, so a custom entry's key loads too.
- **Migration** — `migrate_providers()` runs at launch, no-op once the stack
  exists: seeds Groq first with the previous `llm_provider` behind it as backup,
  reusing the key already on disk. Groq starts keyless, and a keyless entry is
  skipped by the walk, so corrections keep running on the backup until a Groq key
  is pasted — the update can't break a working install.
- **UI** — model cards (name + `first` tag, ↑/↓ reorder, ✕ remove, endpoint /
  model / key rows) inside the settings overlay, in its existing row rhythm, plus
  a live "⚡ running on <backup> · first choice retried in ~N min" line so an
  active fallback is never silent. Dead commands (`set_api_key`,
  `set_llm_provider`, `list_llm_providers`) removed.
- **CSS gotcha worth remembering:** `input[type="text"]` is attribute-specific, so
  a single-class rule loses to it — the card inputs need `.provider-field
  .provider-input` to beat the panel's 60% width cap.

**Tests.** `cargo test --lib` — 32 pass, incl. 13 new in `fallback.rs` (classify
transient vs hard; threshold/cooldown transitions; `run_with_failover`: rescue by
the next entry inside one request, hard error stops the walk, keyless entries
skipped without counting as failures, deep failures don't feed the sticky tally)
plus 3 for the seed/migration. `npm test` — 7 pass. Settings overlay eyeballed in
a headless browser against a stubbed Tauri backend: first-run one-card view,
two-card stack, active-fallback banner.

## 0.1.27 — app icon recolored to sapphire

The UI went sapphire in 0.1.26 but the app icon (Dock, Finder, tray, installer,
Windows .ico) was still the violet feather — a mismatch everywhere the OS shows it.

Recolored the icon to match the accent. The master `icons/icon.png` was hue-rotated
violet → sapphire (−40° hue, ×1.28 saturation) so the rounded-square gradient, the
white feather, the anti-aliasing and the rounded corners stay pixel-identical — only
the blue changes. White feather is untouched (recolor skips near-zero-saturation
pixels). The gradient highlight lands at ~`#67a4f6`, in the `#5b9df7` accent family.

All bundle sizes regenerated from that master with `tauri icon` (32/128/128@2x PNG,
`icon.icns`, `icon.ico`, the Square*Logo set). iOS/Android assets `tauri icon` also
emits were dropped — this is a desktop bundle and `tauri.conf.json` references only
the desktop set.

## 0.1.26 — accent recolor: violet → sapphire ink

The violet accent never sat right. Reskinned to a sapphire blue ("ink on paper"),
chosen from a live side-by-side of the real UI in four palettes (violet, sapphire,
Anthropic clay, amber). Centralized in two tokens plus three stragglers that were
hardcoded violet:

- `--ink` `#a78bfa → #5b9df7`, `--ink-dim` `#6d5bd0 → #3f6fd1` (drives the feather
  mark, your-bubble fill, focus rings, links, send button, hotkey-capture state).
- your-bubble text `#f3effe → #eef4fe`, send glyph `#15101f → #0c1a30`,
  hotkey-capture tint `rgba(167,139,250,.1) → rgba(91,157,247,.12)`.

The stop-button red (`--stop`) is deliberately independent of the accent, so it
stays unambiguous whatever the accent becomes.

## 0.1.25 — stop button: cancel a running correction

**Report.** After sending, there's no way to cancel — you wait out the request.

**Fix.** While a correction is in flight the send arrow becomes a red rounded
"stop" square. Clicking it (or Esc) drops the pending bubble and returns to the
composer. The correction is a single non-streaming request, so "stop" is a UI
cancel: the in-flight call's result is discarded (its bubble already removed) and
you're free to edit and resend — the request may still finish server-side, but
nothing it returns is shown. `editor.js` tracks in-flight corrections by id so a
discarded result can't slip into the chat after you've stopped.

- The send/stop swap is one button: `.composer.generating .send` shows the stop
  glyph in `--stop` red; at rest it's the send arrow.
- Dropped a hardcoded violet hover on the send button (`#b89dfb`) for a
  theme-relative `brightness()` so the hover follows whatever the accent is.

## 0.1.24 — chat opens on the current Space (no desktop teleport)

**Report.** The hotkey "moves me to another desktop" and shows the chat there
instead of popping it where I'm working.

**Cause.** We position the window at the cursor *before* showing it. The window
carried `MoveToActiveSpace` (the same behavior Ribbit uses), but Ribbit never
repositions its window — we do, and positioning a still-hidden window that has a
"home" Space, then showing it, teleported the user to that home Space.

**Fix.** `apply_spaces_behavior` now sets `CanJoinAllSpaces` (1<<0) instead of
`MoveToActiveSpace` (1<<1). With no home Space the window is resident on every
Space, so showing it at the cursor always lands on the current desktop. It's
hidden between uses, so "on every Space" is never visible.

**Capture status (from the 0.1.23 debug log, for the record).** The 0.1.23 ⌘C
fix works: `frontmost: com.quill.app → captured 62 chars`. The one case that
still yields `0 chars` is a selection made *inside* a TUI like Claude Code
running in Ghostty: that selection lives inside the TUI's own redraw (mouse
reporting), so it's never a real terminal selection and ⌘C — Ghostty's copy —
has nothing to grab. No external tool can read a TUI's in-progress input; a
real terminal selection (or any native field / browser) captures fine. Not a
Quill bug, so nothing to fix here — documented so it isn't re-chased.

## 0.1.23 — capture actually works: ⌘C posted with the Command flag set

**The real capture bug, found in the on-disk debug log.** With 0.1.22 signed and
Accessibility granted, the hotkey still captured nothing. The log was decisive:
`hotkey fired → capturing selection` immediately followed by `captured 0 chars`,
on **every** attempt across **every** build going back weeks — and crucially, the
need-access path was *not* taken (so trust was fine). So it was never signing and
never permission: the synthetic ⌘C itself copied nothing.

**Why.** `selection.rs` synthesized the copy via enigo as three events — press
⌘, click C, release ⌘. In many apps (terminals like Ghostty/Terminal, Electron)
the Command flag never landed on the C key event, so the app saw a bare "c", the
copy never fired, and the clipboard stayed the sentinel → `captured 0 chars`.

**Confirmed before shipping, on the same Mac.** A probe drove a properly-flagged
synthetic ⌘C (System Events `keystroke "c" using command down`) over a scratch
selection: the clipboard picked up the text. So a *flagged* ⌘C copies here; the
unflagged enigo chord was the bug.

**The fix.** macOS now posts ⌘C as a raw `CGEvent` with `CGEventFlagCommand` set
directly on the C key event (keycode `0x08`, kVK_ANSI_C) — the synthesis every
selection-grabbing tool relies on. The app reads the flag off the event, so it's
a real ⌘C regardless of layout or which modifiers are physically held. Windows/
Linux keep enigo's Ctrl+C.

- New diagnostic: each capture logs the frontmost app's bundle id
  (`hotkey fired → capturing selection (frontmost: com.mitchellh.ghostty)`), so a
  future `0 chars` is traceable to the exact app it targeted.
- `core-graphics` added as a direct dep (already in the tree via cocoa).
- This is a cert-to-cert update (same signing identity as 0.1.22), so it does
  **not** reset the Accessibility grant — no re-enable needed, and it doubles as
  the first clean update to check whether the VPN now survives.

## 0.1.21 — stable self-signed signing (Accessibility grant survives updates), normal window

**Three reports.** (1) The window floated above every other window — couldn't be
sent behind. (2) After an update the selection wasn't captured: the chat opened
empty and the user had to paste by hand. (3) The VPN still dropped on the 0.1.20
update.

**0.1.20's keychain theory was wrong — corrected here.** The debug log after the
0.1.20 update shows *no* `loaded … from keychain` line (the new file-based build
never touched the keychain) yet the VPN dropped anyway → keychain wasn't the
cause. `tccutil` is ruled out too: Ribbit's `tcc_reset.rs` is byte-identical and
its log resets TCC on every update, but Ribbit's VPN never drops. So both prior
suspects are eliminated by evidence. (Keychain→file from 0.1.20 stays — it does
kill the post-update password prompt — it just wasn't the VPN trigger.)

**Real root cause (capture + the VPN's last lead): ad-hoc signing.** Each ad-hoc
release gets a fresh cdhash, and a TCC grant's designated requirement pins that
cdhash. So after every update the Accessibility grant goes stale: System Settings
still shows Quill "allowed", `AXIsProcessTrusted()` returns true, but the
synthetic ⌘C is filtered at kCGHIDEventTap → `captured 0 chars`. The debug log
(is_trusted true, 0 chars) and the screenshot (Quill toggled on) confirm it. This
is also the **only** remaining Quill-vs-Ribbit difference for the VPN: Quill is
the one that needs the most-privileged grant (Accessibility) re-issued every
update; Ribbit only needs Microphone.

**The fix — stable self-signed certificate.** CI now signs both macOS arches with
a self-signed code-signing cert (secrets `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` /
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`). The designated
requirement then anchors to the **certificate**
(`identifier "com.quill.app" and certificate root = H"…"`), not the cdhash — so
the Accessibility grant survives every update and the selection capture keeps
working. Not notarized (no Apple account), so first launch still needs a
right-click→Open, exactly like the old ad-hoc builds.

**0.1.21's macOS build failed on signing — fixed in 0.1.22.** A self-signed cert
isn't a *valid* codesigning identity until its root is trusted; tauri-action's own
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE` import doesn't add that trust, so the bundler aborted with
`failed to resolve signing identity` (reproduced locally: `codesign --sign` →
`no identity found` without trust). CI now has a dedicated step that builds its own
keychain, imports the p12, and trusts the cert as a `codeSign` root in the System
keychain via passwordless `sudo` (no GUI auth on the runner); the bundler then gets
only `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`. So 0.1.21 shipped Windows-only; the first real signed
macOS build is 0.1.22.

- `tcc_reset.rs` rekeyed off the **signing identity** instead of the cdhash: it
  resets once on the ad-hoc→cert migration (clears the stale ad-hoc grant so the
  user gets a clean prompt), then never again across cert-signed builds. Keying
  off cdhash would have wiped the good grant on every release.
- `selection.rs`: a 20 ms settle on each side of the ⌘ chord, so the OS doesn't
  see a bare "c" (copy never fires) in fussy apps — terminals, Electron.
- Window: `alwaysOnTop` false (was true). It opens at the cursor and takes focus
  on the hotkey, but no longer floats above other windows. Matches Ribbit.
- UI is now all English (was mixed RU/EN): every label, placeholder, tooltip,
  status line, and the one user-facing Rust error. Dropped the "history is local
  only" settings note. Russian stays only in corrector.rs test fixtures (they
  exercise the RU correction path) and in user-entered chat content.

One-time: the transition update re-grants Accessibility once (the old ad-hoc
grant doesn't match the cert-signed binary); from then on it persists. Whether
the VPN survives is verified on the update *after* this one (the first clean,
cert-to-cert update).

## 0.1.20 — store the API key in a file, not the macOS Keychain

**The symptom.** Every Quill update (a) re-prompted for the macOS login password
and (b) dropped the user's corporate VPN (the 2FA-push one). A plain relaunch of
the *same* binary did neither; running `tccutil reset All com.quill.app` by hand
did neither. So the trigger was something Quill does **only on update** that
Ribbit — same updater, same ad-hoc per-arch signing, VPN never drops — does not.

**The difference, found by diffing the two apps.** Build/signing/Info.plist/
updater/restart are byte-identical between Quill and Ribbit (so stable signing
was a dead end — Ribbit isn't stably signed either). The one functional
divergence: **Quill kept the API key in the macOS Keychain (`keyring` crate);
Ribbit keeps it in a config file.** An ad-hoc binary's signature rotates each
release, and a Keychain ACL is anchored to that signature — so the first launch
after an update hits an ACL **mismatch** and macOS does a heavier "signature
changed, re-authorize" pass on the login keychain. That lines up exactly with
both the password prompt and the VPN (whose 2FA session lives in the same login
keychain) dropping on every update.

**The fix (Ribbit's approach).** Store the key in `config_dir/quill/.env`,
written `0600`. Dropped the `keyring` dependency; `secrets.rs` now reads/writes
that file with the same public API (`load_into_env` / `save` / `has_key`), so
lib.rs callers are unchanged. An API key can't be hashed (it's sent to the
provider verbatim), so the realistic choice is keychain-vs-file; the file is the
user's own credential on their own machine, owner-only. Quill never touches the
keychain now.

One-time: the existing key sits in the old Keychain entry the new build no longer
reads, so the key must be re-entered once after updating. Also fixed a stale
capability referencing the removed `main` window.

Confirmation pending: the password prompt is gone for certain; whether the VPN
now survives an update is verified on the next update.

## 0.1.19 — gear always reachable: titlebar stays, the body swaps views

**What was wrong.** 0.1.18 made settings a full-cover overlay (`position:absolute;
inset:0`), which painted over the titlebar too — so once in settings the gear was
gone and there was no way to flip back to the chat/log. (Also two minor CI/build
follow-ups landed as 0.1.18.x.)

**The fix — Ribbit's real structure.** The titlebar is now persistent; only the
body below it swaps between three views:
- `setView("chat"|"settings"|"debug")` toggles `#log`+`#composer` vs
  `#settings-panel` vs `#debug-panel` (each a `.view-panel` flex child, not an
  overlay). The gear lives in the always-visible titlebar, so it flips chat ↔
  settings from either side; it shows an `.active` tint while in settings.
- **Status moved into the titlebar** (under the wordmark), so "Ключ сохранён" /
  "Hotkey: …" is visible from any view.
- Debug log is a third view reached from settings (`>_`) with its own back; Esc
  peels debug → settings → chat → hide window. Capture still owns Esc via
  `.capturing`.
- View switching consolidated in editor.js; settings.js no longer touches the
  debug panel. No second window, no overlay covering the chrome.

Verified headless: the gear is visible in chat, settings, AND debug; the log
hides in settings; the gear toggles back to chat; Esc peels each layer. `vitest`
7/7, no console errors.

## 0.1.18 — one window: the gear flips settings over the chat, no second window

**What was wrong.** 0.1.17 made the chat the app's face but kept settings as a
*separate* window — so clicking the gear opened a second window. The user wanted
one window that switches between the chat (text + history) and settings, exactly
like Ribbit (its gear swaps the log view for a settings view in place).

**The fix — settings is an in-window overlay.**
- The gear now flips a `#settings-panel` overlay over the chat (and a `>_` debug
  overlay above that), the same way the chat already overlaid its debug log.
  `showView`-style toggling, one window — mirrors Ribbit's gear behaviour.
- **Esc peels back one layer**: debug → settings → hide the window. While a
  shortcut capture is live, settings.js owns Esc (cancels capture) — editor.js
  defers via the `.capturing` class on the kbd.
- The settings **window is gone**. Removed the `main` window from
  `tauri.conf.json`; the chat (`editor`) is the only window, sized 420×580 to
  fit both views. Rounded-corners / Spaces polish now applies to it alone.
- **Frontend consolidated.** Settings logic moved out of the deleted
  `main.js`/`index.html`/`styles.css` into a new `settings.js` module
  (`initSettings()`), imported by `editor.js`; its styles ported into
  `editor.css` as `.panel` overlays. `shortcut.js` is shared by both.
- **Backend trimmed.** Removed the now-dead commands `show_main_window`,
  `hide_to_tray`, `show_from_tray`, `set_always_on_top` and the `show-settings`
  event. First-run onboarding reveals the chat window; editor.js sees the
  missing API key and opens the settings overlay itself (no cross-window event).

Verified: `cargo check` clean (only pre-existing cocoa deprecation warnings);
`vitest` 7/7 green; headless render of both views (chat with day-separated
history + settings overlay) — one window, gear toggles, Esc peels layers, no
console errors.

## 0.1.17 — the chat is the only face; the old clock-log window is gone

**The regression it fixes.** Every update restarts the app, and on launch the
*settings* window (which still carried the old clock-rewind history list) popped
up on its own. So after updating, the user saw the thing we'd replaced — a log
with clock tongues, no composer, no chat — and reasonably thought the chat was
gone. The chat was fine; it was just a second window that only opened on the
hotkey, while the wrong window greeted them on launch.

**The fix — collapse to one face.**
- The **chat is the app**. The tray icon (click + "Show" menu) now toggles the
  chat window, not settings. The hotkey already opened the chat.
- **Nothing pops on launch.** Both windows are `visible: false`; Quill lives in
  the tray. The sole exception is genuine first-run with no API key, which opens
  settings so the hotkey isn't a dead end.
- The **settings window is settings only**. Removed the clock-rewind history
  list and the search box from it (and their dead CSS) — there are no clock
  tongues anywhere now. It opens only from the chat's gear (`show_main_window`).
- Tray retarget: `toggle_main_window` → `toggle_chat_window` (targets the editor
  window); launch-time onboarding check added in `setup`.

History still lives in the chat (loaded on open, day-separated). Settings keeps
model / key / hotkey / update / debug.

## 0.1.16 — blank when empty; day separators in the chat (Ribbit parity)

- **Empty chat is empty.** Dropped the "select text and press ⌃⌥E" greeting.
  First open with no history shows nothing — like Ribbit's log.
- **Day separators.** Between calendar days the chat now draws a thin rule with
  a small `we, jun 25th` label (weekday + month + ordinal day). Ported verbatim
  from Ribbit's `formatDate` + `.date-sep`, placed in chat order (a day's
  separator heads its first message, oldest day at top).
- Retention was already Ribbit's exact mechanism (shared `logger.rs`: a rolling
  window of day-files, today + the previous N-1 days, default 7) — left as is.
- Select-text → hotkey → it lands in the chat and is corrected automatically was
  already in place (the `editor:capture` path); no copy/paste needed.

## 0.1.15 — update progress in one place

`downloading NN%` was shown both on the update button and in the header
subtitle. Now only on the button (Ribbit-style); update failures land there too,
then re-arm for retry.

## 0.1.14 — the hotkey opens a chat at the cursor; copy instead of type-back

The editor popup becomes a chat, and the two things that still felt broken
after 0.1.13 are fixed.

**What was wrong.**
- The popup opened on whichever Space it last lived on. The user pressed the
  hotkey, saw nothing, and only later found the window on another desktop.
- The 0.1.13 "grant Accessibility" screen was a half-screen overlay that
  couldn't be moved or closed — worse than the problem. The macOS system
  prompt already does the job.
- Typing the corrected text back over the selection was the fragile half of
  the Accessibility story. Copying needs none of that reach.

**The redesign.**
- `editor.*` is now a chat. The captured selection lands as your bubble (accent,
  right); the correction replies below it (panel, left). A composer at the
  bottom takes typed/pasted text — Enter sends, Shift+Enter newlines — through
  the same correct→reply path, so re-polishing is: click your bubble (copies),
  paste, tweak, Enter. **Click any bubble to copy it** to the clipboard; you
  paste it yourself. No more type-back, no clock-to-rewind tongues.
- **Window opens at the mouse cursor**, clamped to the cursor's screen, on the
  active Space. New `mac_window::position_at_cursor` (`NSEvent.mouseLocation` +
  `NSScreen.visibleFrame`), run on the main thread before `show()`.
- **No in-app permission overlay.** When Accessibility isn't granted the hotkey
  pops the real macOS dialog and shows the chat with one quiet inline note
  (`editor:need-access`).
- Dropped the type-back path: removed `inserter.rs`, `mac_focus.rs`,
  `apply_correction`, and `AppState::target_pid`. Added `copy_to_clipboard`
  (arboard) and `show_main_window` (the gear → settings, landing on the
  settings view via `show-settings`).
- `editor_correct` now records the original→corrected pair in history itself
  (unchanged "already clean" text isn't logged). History loads into the chat
  oldest-at-top on open.
- The chat's gear glows green when an update is waiting; the install button
  still lives in settings.

Capture still uses the synthetic ⌘C, so reading the selection needs
Accessibility — but that is now the *only* thing that does.

## 0.1.13 — the hotkey never dies silently; ask for Accessibility out loud

The recurring "Quill doesn't work after an update" finally fixed at the root.

**The bug.** Each release rotates the ad-hoc cdhash, so `tcc_reset` wipes the
Accessibility grant — and then the hotkey would capture the selection with a
synthetic ⌘C that macOS silently filters (no permission), get nothing, and
*open no window at all*. From the user's seat: press the hotkey, nothing
happens, no hint why. The old code assumed macOS would re-prompt on the next
synthetic keystroke; it doesn't — posting an event without the grant just fails
quietly, it never triggers a prompt.

**The fix.**
- New `accessibility.rs`: `is_trusted()` (`AXIsProcessTrusted`) and `prompt()`
  (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` with the prompt option) — the latter pops the
  real macOS "allow Quill to control this computer" dialog. Needs the
  `core-foundation` crate + the ApplicationServices framework.
- `launch_editor` rewritten so **the window always opens**. If we're not trusted
  it pops the macOS dialog and shows the editor on a "grant access" screen
  instead of attempting a doomed silent ⌘C. If we are trusted it captures and
  opens as before — and now even an *empty* capture opens the window (type/paste)
  rather than dying.
- Editor gains a permission screen (`editor:permission` event): explains it needs
  Accessibility, with **Open System Settings** (`open_accessibility_settings`)
  and **I've enabled it → retry** (`accessibility_status`) buttons.

After an update the flow is now Ribbit-like: press the hotkey → macOS asks for
the grant → enable Quill → it works. No more silent dead key press.

Still ad-hoc signed, so the grant doesn't *survive* updates yet — a stable
signing identity (so the cdhash stops rotating) is the next step. But the app no
longer hides the problem.

## 0.1.12 — search, Ribbit-style updates, and minimalist polish

Front-end only again; same data, same Rust. Brings the main window the rest of
the way to Ribbit's minimalism.

- **Search (magnifier in the header).** A live filter popup, like Ribbit — but
  it matches the *original* text too, not just the corrected result. A row stays
  if the query hits either side; matches are highlighted (`<mark>`). When the hit
  is only in the original (hidden under the clock), the **clock lights up** so you
  know to hold it — and holding reveals the original with the match highlighted.
  Substring match, case-insensitive. `entryMatchesQuery`/`highlightInto`/
  `applySearch`/`renderRowText` in main.js; `#search-btn` + `#search-popup`.
- **Updates work exactly like Ribbit now.** The standalone footer button is gone
  (the whole footer is); the update control lives in settings, and when a release
  is found the **gear glows green** so you spot it from the log without opening
  settings. Inside, the button shows `update to vX`, then `downloading N%` on the
  button itself, then the app restarts. `setupUpdates` rewritten as a clean
  swap-the-onclick state machine (check ⇄ install) to avoid Ribbit's
  double-handler quirk; `.update-available` glow on both `#update-btn` and
  `#settings-btn`.
- **Minimalist header.** Dropped the persistent "Ready" — the status subtitle is
  empty (and hidden) at rest, surfacing only while a correction or download is in
  flight, then clearing. Just "Quill" the rest of the time.
- **Empty state actually centers.** It used to share the column with the
  (empty) list and drift below middle; the list is hidden when there are no
  entries, so the welcome sits dead-centre.

## 0.1.11 — main window: a chat-style log + settings behind a gear

Front-end only; the correction flow and the whole Rust side are untouched. The
main window used to greet you with the model/key card and a hotkey hint up top
and the history below — settings shouting before you'd done anything. **Now** it
opens like Ribbit's log: a clean chat-style list of past corrections (newest on
top), and settings tuck behind a gear in the header.

- **Settings behind the gear.** New `⚙` button in the titlebar toggles between
  the log (`#log-view`) and a `#settings-panel` that holds Hotkey, Model, API
  key and the debug-log opener (Ribbit-style label-left / control-right rows).
  When there's no API key yet, startup auto-opens settings so onboarding still
  works. View switch is a plain show/hide (`showView`), debug stays an overlay.
- **Status moved to a header subtitle.** The standalone status pill is gone;
  the live state ("Ready / working / done / error") is now a quiet line under
  the wordmark, colour-coded, settling back to "Ready". Keeps the body clean.
- **Log rows redesigned (`logRow`).** Each finished correction is a flat row —
  time, the polished text, and on the right a **clock** you *press and hold* to
  reveal the original (dimmed + italic), releasing to snap back to the corrected
  text. Pointer-capture on press so the release restores even if the cursor
  drifts off the button. Unchanged corrections show "already clean" instead of a
  clock (nothing to peek at). Replaces the old click-anywhere-to-toggle card.
- **Empty state.** A centred "Nothing yet" + the hotkey hint, shown when the log
  is empty — the clean welcome, no settings in sight.
- Data is unchanged: `get_log_history` / the `correction` event / `logger.rs`
  per-day JSONL store all stay as-is; only the rendering changed.

## 0.1.10 — editor window: review before it lands (Grammarly-style redesign, phase 1)

The big UX shift. **Was:** the hotkey silently replaced the selection with the
corrected text — no feedback, no chance to read what changed or tweak it before
it landed. **Now:** the hotkey captures the selection and opens a dedicated Quill
editor window over it; the window runs the correction itself, shows the result
for you to read and hand-edit, and on **Apply** it re-activates the app you were
in and types the final text back over the (still-present) selection. **Cancel /
Esc** types nothing — the original is left untouched.

Mechanics worth knowing for the next change:
- New `editor` webview window (label `editor`, hidden until the hotkey fires;
  preloaded at startup so its event listener is live). Shares the `default`
  capability with `main` (added `editor` to the capability's window list) so it
  can invoke commands and listen for events.
- `mac_focus.rs` (new, macOS): grabs the frontmost app's pid via
  `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` at capture time — *before* our window steals
  focus — and re-activates it (`NSRunningApplication.activateWithOptions`) just
  before typing. This is the load-bearing new risk: showing a window means the
  target app loses focus, so the type-back now depends on returning it. Off-macOS
  it's a no-op (hiding our window already restores focus there).
- `lib.rs`: the hotkey no longer corrects+inserts; it captures → remembers the
  front app → shows the editor → emits `editor:open` with the text. New commands:
  `editor_correct` (async + `spawn_blocking` so the editor UI keeps animating
  during the round-trip), `apply_correction` (logs history, hides editor,
  re-activates the target, types), `close_editor` (cancel). The tray "working"
  glyph was dropped — the editor window is now the feedback surface.
- Front end: `editor.html/.css/.js` — a textarea over the captured text with a
  status line and Apply/Recheck/Cancel. ⌘⏎ applies, Esc cancels. A `reqId`
  stale-guard already gates the correction (load-bearing once live re-checking
  lands in a later phase). Styling mirrors the settings window's tokens.

Still to come (later phases): live per-word underlines on what changed,
click-a-word to see было→стало and accept/reject, select-a-chunk to rewrite, and
debounced re-checking as you type. This phase is the window + focus-return
foundation only.

Verification: compiles clean, the 16 unit tests stay green, and the editor
window was eyeballed via a headless render (matches Quill's look). The
focus-return + type-back across real apps (Telegram, browser, Mail) is the one
path that needs this live release to confirm — it can't be exercised from a
headless build.

## 0.1.9 — menu-bar "working" indicator

The settings window lives in the tray, so when you trigger a correction from
another app (Telegram, a browser) there was no on-screen sign anything was
happening during the ~3s LLM round-trip — it read as "nothing happens / broken".
Now the menu-bar tray shows a "…" while a correction is in flight and clears when
done. (Verified end-to-end that the correction itself works — incl. in Telegram;
the menu-bar glyph rendering couldn't be eyeballed from the build environment.)

## 0.1.8 — update progress feedback + flow logging

- The update button gave no feedback during the 20-30s download — the click felt
  dead. It now shows live progress ("downloading 45%") and mirrors it in the
  status line, driven by the `update-progress` events the Rust side already
  emitted but the UI ignored (mirrors Ribbit). Also collapsed the update click
  logic into a single handler (no more stray `onclick` double-firing with the
  `addEventListener` one).
- Instrumented the correction flow: logs "hotkey fired → capturing" and
  "captured N chars" so a silent no-op is diagnosable from the debug log instead
  of leaving no trace. (Verified the full select→correct→insert path end-to-end
  on macOS via a synthetic hotkey against TextEdit — works; the engine, capture,
  and insert are all fine.)

## 0.1.7 — fix crash when triggering a correction (macOS)

**What:** pressing the hotkey instantly crashed Quill on macOS (SIGTRAP).

**Was:** selection capture synthesized ⌘C with `enigo.key(Key::Unicode('c'))`.
On macOS that makes enigo resolve the keycode through the Text Input Source APIs
(TSM / HIToolbox), which `dispatch_assert_queue` the **main thread** and abort the
process when called from our worker thread — and the whole correction flow runs
on a worker thread. The ⌘ modifier was fine (fixed keycode); only the
layout-dependent `'c'` lookup tripped the assert. (`enigo.text()`, used to type
the result, takes the CGEvent Unicode path and is safe off-main — which is why
Ribbit, which only ever types, never hit this.)

**Now:** on macOS we send the raw keycode of the physical C key
(`Key::Other(0x08)` = kVK_ANSI_C), which skips the TSM lookup — no main-thread
requirement, no crash. Bonus: ⌘C now fires regardless of the active keyboard
layout (e.g. a Cyrillic layout), which suits a bilingual tool. Windows keeps
`Key::Unicode('c')` (no TSM there).

**Tests:** a guard test pins the macOS copy key as a raw keycode (never
`Key::Unicode`), so this crash class can't quietly return.

## 0.1.6 — platform-correct hotkey labels

The hotkey was rendered in Windows form ("ctrl+alt+e") everywhere, including on
macOS, where it should read ⌃⌥E. The stored binding is unchanged (Tauri's
lowercase form — the same physical keys on both OSes); only the *label* is now
platform-aware: glyphs with no separators on macOS (⌃⌥E, ⌘⇧Space), spelled-out
"Ctrl + Alt + E" on Windows. Applied in the window, the live capture display, and
the status line. New `prettyShortcut(raw, isMac)` helper in shortcut.js, unit-
tested both ways. README "How it works" now shows both forms.

## 0.1.3 — one-click platform downloads

The README download buttons now link **straight to the installer** for each
platform instead of dumping you on the Releases page full of every file.

The snag: tauri names assets with the version baked in (`Quill_<ver>_aarch64.dmg`),
and GitHub's stable `releases/latest/download/<name>` redirect needs an exact,
unchanging filename. Fix: CI now re-uploads version-less copies to each release
— `Quill_macOS_AppleSilicon.dmg`, `Quill_macOS_Intel.dmg`, `Quill_Windows_Setup.exe`
(via `gh release upload --clobber` after each build) — and the README buttons
point at those. The versioned files + `.sig` + `latest.json` still ship for the
auto-updater; the stable names are purely for the human download buttons.

## 0.1.2 — real Quill icon

Replaced the inherited Ribbit frog placeholder with Quill's own icon: a white
feather on a violet-ink gradient squircle (matches the app's accent colour).
Source rendered from an SVG; full icon set regenerated via `tauri icon`. Dropped
the iOS/Android icon variants `tauri icon` emits — Quill is desktop-only. Added
`src/quill.png` (256px) for the GitHub profile card. First change to ride the
CI → in-app-update loop end to end.

## 0.1.0 — initial build (forked from Ribbit)

First version. Quill is the text-correction twin of Ribbit (voice-to-text):
same Tauri v2 shell, same hotkey/tray/updater/keychain plumbing, the audio
pipeline swapped for a selection→correct→insert flow.

**What it does.** Global hotkey (default `ctrl+alt+e`) → grab the current
selection → send it to an LLM that fixes spelling/punctuation/grammar in RU or
EN without changing meaning or tone → type the corrected text back over the
selection.

**Kept from Ribbit (unchanged plumbing):** `inserter.rs` (type via `enigo`, no
clipboard paste), `mac_window.rs`, `tcc_reset.rs` (cdhash-rotation permission
re-arm), the tray, the auto-updater, the debug log, and the LLM HTTP client
shape (providers table, retry-once, response parsing) now in `corrector.rs`.

**New / changed:**
- `selection.rs` — the one genuinely new piece. Captures the selection by
  seeding the clipboard with a sentinel, synthesizing the platform Copy chord
  (⌘C / Ctrl+C), polling until the clipboard changes (≈1s ceiling), then
  restoring the original clipboard. Empty after the poll ⇒ nothing was selected.
  We insert by typing, so the clipboard is only ever touched here.
- `corrector.rs` — Ribbit's `postprocess.rs`, retargeted. Dropped the dictation
  vocab. New bilingual system prompt: correct only, never translate, preserve
  tone, return only the text. `max_tokens` now scales with input length so a
  long paragraph isn't truncated (floor 512, cap 8192). Timeout raised 5s→20s
  (a paragraph correction can take a few seconds).
- `secrets.rs` — new. API key in the OS keychain (`keyring`, apple-native /
  windows-native) instead of a plaintext `.env`. Loaded into the process env at
  startup so the corrector reads it the usual way.
- `lib.rs` — rewritten. New `AppState { busy, current_shortcut }`. The hotkey
  fires the flow on **Release** (so the chord's modifiers are up before we
  synthesize ⌘C) with a 60ms settle delay, guarded by `busy` against re-fire.
  Identical-output short-circuit (don't re-type when nothing changed). Config
  dir renamed `ribbit`→`quill`. Dropped audio/transcribe/sound/vocab/usage and
  their deps (cpal, rodio, rusqlite); added arboard + keyring.
- Frontend rewritten as a focused settings window: live status line, model +
  key, click-to-change hotkey, local correction history (click a row to reveal
  the original), update + debug controls. New visual language — dark slate base
  shared with the Ribbit family, system-sans, ink-violet accent.

**Prompt-injection guard.** The selection is arbitrary user content shipped to
an LLM, so the system prompt explicitly tells the model the text is content to
correct, never instructions to obey. Pinned by a unit test.

**Tests.** 15 Rust unit tests (provider table, prompt guarantees + injection
guard, payload shape + max_tokens scaling, response parsing/quote-stripping,
empty/no-key guards) + 4 JS tests for the hotkey-string builder. All green.

**Known follow-ups (not in this version):**
- App/tray icon is still Ribbit's frog placeholder — needs a Quill icon set.
- Updater pubkey in `tauri.conf.json` is a placeholder — a real minisign
  keypair must be generated and its private half added as the CI signing secret
  before the first release.
- Keychain ACL is anchored to the code signature; an ad-hoc-signed build may
  re-prompt for keychain access once per release (same class as the TCC reset).
  If that gets annoying, swap the storage backend in `secrets.rs` — nothing else
  changes.
- Selection capture restores text clipboard contents only (images/files aren't
  preserved across the ~1s borrow).
